# Group Do: Designing your MVP

## Instructions
* With your group, answer each of the following questions:
  1. Who is your target audience?
  2. What is the problem that the product will address?
  3. What is the primary goal of the product?
  4. Identify and prioritize essential user stories (limit this to 3 or fewer)?
  5. What is the general idea of your project?

* Remember, your MVP should be the absolute *minimum* product that you need to pitch your idea to investors (or your classmates). Think bare essentials.
